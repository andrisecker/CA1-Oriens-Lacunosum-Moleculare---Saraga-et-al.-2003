### Single compartment cell, with the channels of the soma

The LEMS file [LEMS_SaragaOLM.xml](https://github.com/andrisecker/CA1-Oriens-Lacunosum-Moleculare---Saraga-et-al.-2003/blob/master/NeuroML2/test_channels/LEMS_SaragaOLM.xml) creates a soma with the 4 somatic channels in order to test and validate the converted channels.

The folder [channel_dynamics](https://github.com/andrisecker/CA1-Oriens-Lacunosum-Moleculare---Saraga-et-al.-2003/tree/master/NeuroML2/test_channels/channel_dynamics) contains figures, made with [pyNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML): pynml-channelanalysis; as in the published paper (Fig2).
